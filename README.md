# NHANES SQL Analysis Project

This project recreates a simplified version of the CDC’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database using **SQLite**.  
It includes demographic, body measures, blood pressure, diabetes, and lipid data for a small sample of participants, designed for teaching SQL joins and summary queries.

## Database Structure
- **demographics** — ID, age, gender, race  
- **bmi** — BMI values with measurement date  
- **bp** — Three systolic and diastolic BP readings per participant  
- **diabetes** — Insulin use indicator  
- **lipids** — Triglyceride levels
